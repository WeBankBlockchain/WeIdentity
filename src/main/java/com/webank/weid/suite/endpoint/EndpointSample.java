         Here the registered endpoint name MUST be the PATH segment of the serviceUrl, and
         the HOST:PORT segment of the serviceUrl must be registered beforehand, and must be
         strictly same as in the REST-service side's application.properties.
         See an example:
         Suppose the serviceUrl is http://10.173.176.98/fetch-data, then endpoint name here must
         be registered as "fetch-data", and "10.173.176.98:6010" must be put in REST-service
         (suppose your endpoint service SDK side occupied port 6010). So, the workflow is like:
          1) SDK side calls registerEndpoint() and puts 6010 in weidentity.properties
          2) endpoint REST side puts 10.173.176.98:6010 in application.properteis
          3) Boot up both sides
          4) endpoint REST side fetches endpoints (including "fetch-data") from SDK
             side (101.73.176.98:6010)
          5) endpoint REST side receives an authToken credential with claimed serviceUrl as
             http://10.173.176.98/fetch-data
          6) endpoint REST side will extract HOST:PORT (10.173.176.98), and search the term (i.e.
             10.173.176.98:6010) in local endpoints info. Note: if a different port than 6010 is
             used, serviceUrl must clearly specify it e.g. http://10.173.176.98:6011/fetch-data
          7) endpoint REST side will also search the requestName with key "fetch-data" in its local
             endpoints info.
          8) endpoint REST side finds the endpoint, so an RPC call is sent to 10.173.176.98:6010,
             piggybacking the resourceId.
          9) the SDK side receives the RPC call and invoke the execute() to return authorized data.
