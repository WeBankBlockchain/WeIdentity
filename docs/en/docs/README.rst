----------

WeIdentity Java SDK provides a Java library suite to manage WeIdentity.
Currently, it supports local key management, digital ID (WeIdentity
DID) management, standard attestation (WeIdentity Credential) management,
Authority Issuer and Claim Protocol Type (CPT) management. It also provides
functionalities to work on FISCO-BCOS blockchain to deploy and run smart
contracts. More features and applications will be supported in near future.
